The project contains several files, including:

main.py: Likely the main Python script.

pyproject.toml: A project configuration file, suggesting it's a Python project (possibly using Poetry or similar tools).

.replit: Indicates it might be a Replit-hosted project.

.gitignore and .git/: Version control setup.

uv.lock: A dependency lock file (suggests use of the uv Python package manager).

Next, I’ll inspect the main.py and pyproject.toml files to understand the project’s purpose and generate a suitable README.md. 

From the inspection, here's what we know:

🧠 Project Overview
This is a Streamlit web application for simulating AI-based rooftop solar analysis. It allows users to upload rooftop images and get simulated outputs related to solar panel type, mounting configuration, and financial incentives.

🔧 Dependencies
Defined in pyproject.toml:

# AI Rooftop Solar Analysis Simulator

This is a Streamlit-based web application that simulates an AI-powered rooftop analysis tool. Users can upload images of rooftops and receive simulated results for optimal solar panel type, mounting system, electrical configuration, and cost estimation.

## 🌞 Features

- Upload rooftop images
- Simulated AI analysis:
  - Solar panel type recommendation
  - Mounting type (roof/ground/building-integrated)
  - Electrical configuration (grid-tied/off-grid/hybrid)
  - Estimated system cost and savings
- Incentive calculation based on federal tax credits

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `uv` (optional dependency manager) or install with pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-solar-analyzer.git
cd ai-solar-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or use pyproject.toml if using Poetry/uv
Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run main.py
